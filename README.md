# Todo list tracker
 
## A simple `Todo list tracker`, using `reactjs + vite`, and `tailwind`.

### You can  easily `download` this repo by going to the `code button`, after pressing it click on `Download zip`.

### After `Downloading` it, open in `VS-code`, and run the <clipboard-copy for="blob-path">`npm run dev`</clipboard-copy> command in the terminal, and copy or manually type `[local](http://localhost:5173/)` your project start working.

### Here is some representation of my `Todo list tracker` project.
